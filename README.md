# Pythonic CodingBat! 

[CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java) is a great website for solving beginner to intermediate programming challenges directly online. It has a section for Python and Java, but the Java section has *many* more problems. I decided to challenge myself to solve all of the Java problems in Python, along with using Python's built-in `unittest` library to create test suites for each problem set!

The goal of this project was not to come up with the most efficient solution for each problem. Instead, I wanted to focus on practicing Python's language features by writing code the way experienced Python developers would (i.e. in a *Pythonic* style).
